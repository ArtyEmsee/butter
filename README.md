# Butter

A butter solution to churning, this application aims to
solve a UI/UX problem faced by many churners currently using spreadsheets. While full of information, spreadsheets aren't easy to look at, and butter solves that issue. With just a glance, a user will be able to see pertinent information about their rewards and card spending status, helping them make decisions to earn more rewards.

## Getting Started

```
$ yarn        # installs dependencies
$ yarn start  # starts the development server

```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

### Running the Tests

There is a basic test framework in your `test/` folder. Here's how to use it:

```bash
$ npm test                 # runs all tests
$ npm test server/index.js # runs tests in a single file
```

### Hot Module Reloading

Butter uses webpack's hot module reloading to update packages and refresh pages without having to restart the server or reload the page manually.
