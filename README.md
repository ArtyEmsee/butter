# Butter

A butter solution to churning, this application aims to
solve a UI/UX problem faced by many churners currently using spreadsheets. While full of information, spreadsheets aren't easy to look at. With just a glance, you will be able to see pertinent information about your earned rewards and card spending status, helping you stay on top of your churning.

## Getting Started

```
$ yarn        # installs dependencies
$ yarn start  # starts the development server

```

Now visit [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)

### Running the Tests
There is a basic test framework in your `test/` folder. Here's how to use it:

```bash
$ npm test                 # runs all tests
$ npm test server/index.js # runs tests in a single file
```

### Hot Module Reloading
Butter uses webpack's hot module reloading to update packages and refresh pages without having to restart the server or reload the page manually, making it quicker and easier to see your changes in close to real time. See `Getting Started` for setting it up.
